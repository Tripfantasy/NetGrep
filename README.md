# NetGrep
Collection of functions for large-scale downstream gene regulatory network analysis. Functions are currently adapted for use with pySCENIC.

Checklist:
- [x] **GoNet**: Visualize significant gene ontology as a network.
- [x] **SubNetGrep**: Examine a sub-network surrounding any gene in the network.
- [ ] **InflectionFilter**: Filter regulon object based on target gene weight distribution.
- [ ] **FindTF**: Query a gene by symbol and list what TFs target it in the network.
- [ ] GUI Adaptation for interactive network analysis. (Flask)
